            The <strong>Phombo Awajung Family</strong> belongs to the Limbu community,
            an indigenous group with deep-rooted traditions, history, and respect for
            ancestry. The Phombo clan represents unity, responsibility, and cultural
            continuity passed down through generations.
        </p>

        <p>
            Within Limbu culture, it is traditionally believed that individuals from the
            same Phombo lineage should not marry each other. This practice preserves
            kinship respect, ancestral bonds, and social harmony within the community.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Awajung lineage of the Phombo family gathers regularly to celebrate
            cultural programs, rituals, and community events. These gatherings are not
            only moments of joy but also opportunities to teach younger generations
            about identity, values, and heritage.
        </p>

        <p>
            This website has been created as a digital home for the Phombo Awajung Family —
            a place to preserve memories, share photographs, document yearly programs,
            and strengthen our connection across locations and generations.
